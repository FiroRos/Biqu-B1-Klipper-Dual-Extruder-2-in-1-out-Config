# Biqu-B1-Klipper-Dual-Extruder-2-in-1-out-Config
I saw that there is a lot of confusion around the dual extruder upgrade kit's marlin firmware, so I decided to update the printers firmware to klipper
*****Im waiting for the dual extruder  kit to arrive so the dual extruder setup is currently commented out
